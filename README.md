# The Data Incubator
The data incubator is a data camp that only chose the top 5% applicants 
as fellows.Through the program, I have learned hands-experience 
about webscraping, spark, SQL, neural network and machine learning. 
It really helped me to take my programming and machine learning 
capabilities to the next level. Each week I completed miniprojects on
diverse and up-to-date topics. Below is a description of introducing topics
and the tools used.

## The new york social graph
[New York Social Diary](http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/) provides photos
of new york social elite. The caption for each photo forms a natural social graph 
Using this graph, we can get the most popular socialites, the most influential
people, and the most tightly couple pairs.

The data were parsed using BeautifulSoup by scraping html, I also used the spaCy's
entity recognition to get names. Finally, I ran the graph analysis using networkx.
